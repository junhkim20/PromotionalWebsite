		<h3>Recycling helps save energy. If you recycle one glass bottle, it saves enough energy to light a 100-watt bulb for four hours, power a computer for 30 minutes, or a television for 20 minutes. Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to run a 55-inch HDTV to watch your favorite movie.</h3>

		<h3> It conserves energy, reduces air and water pollution, reduces greenhouse gases, and conserves natural resources.</h3>

		<h3>Recycling helps to reduce energy usage, reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, reduce air pollution and water pollution (from landfilling) by reducing the need for “conventional” waste disposal and also reduces greenhouse gas emissions. </h3>
